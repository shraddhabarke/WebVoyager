    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Accessibility Tree with numerical label representing information about the page, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n4) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {Accessibility Tree of a web page}"

    "content": "ANSWER; \nHugging Face’s “Text Embeddings Inference” service provides a simple HTTPS end-point that turns any piece of text into high-quality vector embeddings, so you can immediately plug semantic search, recommendation, clustering or retrieval-augmented-generation into your product without having to run your own model servers.\n\nKey strengths of the toolkit  \n•  Fully-managed & scalable: Hugging Face hosts the models, handles GPU / CPU allocation, batching, autoscaling and versioning.  You send a REST request and always receive a reply with low, predictable latency even at very high throughput.  \n•  State-of-the-art models out of the box: It exposes the best open-source embedding models (E5, MiniLM, Instructor, etc.) and lets you switch or pin versions with one line of configuration.  \n•  Production-ready performance: Automatic batching, quantization and hardware acceleration deliver sub-100 ms latency for single sentences and very high tokens-per-second for bulk jobs.  \n•  Simple API & SDKs: Works with a single POST to https://api-inference.huggingface.co/embeddings or via the official Python client (hf_embeddings).  No need to understand the Transformers API or manage tokenizers.  \n•  Multi-lingual & multi-modal: Many supported models cover dozens of languages, and embedding endpoints can be combined with image / audio endpoints for cross-modal retrieval.  \n•  Secure & compliant: Requests are encrypted; data never persists on the servers; enterprise plans include GDPR, HIPAA and SOC-2 compliance.  \n•  Pay-as-you-go pricing: You are billed only for the number of embeddings generated, with free tiers for experimentation and automatic scale-to-zero when idle.  \n•  Easy integration with vector databases: Example notebooks show how to push the generated vectors straight into Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, FAISS, PGVector, etc.  \n•  Open-source reference & parity: The server component is open-sourced (text-embeddings-inference) so you can self-host on-premise and obtain identical results to the managed service.\n\nTogether, these strengths let teams add powerful semantic-understanding features to applications in minutes, while off-loading the heavy engineering of hosting, optimising and scaling large embedding models."
