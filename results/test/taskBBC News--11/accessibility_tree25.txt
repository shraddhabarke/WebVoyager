				[39135] StaticText 'As a drab contest entered its final stages, Scotland striker Nisbet controlled a Graeme Shinnie cross on his chest, before arcing a dipping volley over goalkeeper Jordan Smith and high into the Hibs net.'
				[39137] StaticText 'It earned Scottish Cup finalists Aberdeen a first win over Hibs this season and moves them level on points with their visitors with four games remaining.'
				[39141] StaticText 'Martin Boyle shot just past a post early on after Aberdeen had played themselves into trouble, and Josh Campbell and Rocky Bushiri went close, too.'
				[39143] StaticText 'Bushiri played his part at the other end, blocking efforts from Pape Habib Gueye and Topi Keskinen.'
				[39145] StaticText 'But the fact neither goalkeeper had a significant save of note to make tells the story of a frustrating opening 45 minutes.'
