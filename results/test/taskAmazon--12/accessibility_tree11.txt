			[34850] StaticText 'I remember growing up and always wishing I had an electric toy vehicle like this, but it was always ludicrously expensive and my parents could only afford so much. It remained one of those things I wish I had as a kid, but I’m so excited that I found something, not only inexpensive, but enjoyable for my kids.'
			[34853] StaticText 'I bought this exact model three years ago and at first, I was worried that it wasn’t going to last long or that it was going to give me problems - but hey, I couldn’t beat the price. So, I gave it a try. 3 years of constant use later, it’s still holding strong.'
			[34856] StaticText 'It takes about 15-20 minutes to assemble and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. It recommends a 12 hour initial charge, and I’ve noticed the full charge lasts maybe… 1.5 hours or so? Going at full speed? The battery’s not up to snuff as it was when I first bought it, but I’m thinking it’s an easy replace too.'
			[34859] StaticText 'The durability is also great. My son’s driven through dirt paths, rocky trails, pavement and it’s been a sturdy vehicle through them.'
			[34862] StaticText 'The Bluetooth feature is really nice! A special touch that lets us listen to his favorite tunes as he’s cruising outside.'
			[34865] StaticText 'The remote control feature is my favorite part. We bought it initially when my son was too young to drive it on his own, so he absolutely enjoyed me driving him around using the remote. Now that he can drive it on his own, I keep it around to keep him in check in the event he strays too far or out into the road.'
			[34868] StaticText 'All-in-all, this product delivered my wishes to be able to give my kids something I missed out on as a kid. Thanks!'

			[35071] StaticText 'Build quality is good, doesn’t have storage but only fit one kid comfortably, haven’t tried the remote control but my nephew does have a hard time backing up/ turning because the wheel doesn’t turn much. Battery life is pretty good also. The seat belt is my only concern because it’s just a basic trap, they definitely could’ve engineered that better especially for a kids car. All in all it’s a good quality took about 30-40 minutes to put together.'
