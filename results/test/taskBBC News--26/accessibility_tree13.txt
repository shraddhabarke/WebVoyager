					[6602] StaticText 'More than 2,700 people were killed in a devastating earthquake that hit Myanmar on 28 March'
			[6605] StaticText 'In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, there is a 72-hour "golden window" when those trapped under rubble are most likely to survive.'
			[6607] StaticText 'But in the 72 hours after a 7.7 magnitude quake struck Myanmar on Friday, rescue and relief workers seeking access to some of the worst-hit areas were blocked by military authorities, multiple aid and human rights groups told the BBC.'
			[6609] StaticText 'This was despite a rare plea for international humanitarian assistance by junta chief Min Aung Hlaing.'
			[6611] StaticText '"I would like to invite any country, any organisation, or anyone in Myanmar to come and help," he said in a speech shortly after the disaster, claiming he had "opened all ways for foreign aid".'
			[6613] StaticText 'On the ground, things moved less freely.'
			[6615] StaticText '"I\'ve talked to a few people now that were part of the rescue efforts in both Sagaing and Mandalay, and they said that [the military] imposed a curfewâ€¦ the roads were blocked, the checkpoints were really long, and there was a huge checking of goods and services going in and a lot of questioning," John Quinley, director of international human rights group Fortify Rights, told the BBC.'
			[6617] StaticText '"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in," he added. "Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don\'t believe that\'s totally legitimate."'
