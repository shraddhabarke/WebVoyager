			[6635] StaticText 'On Tuesday night, an attack on an aid convoy further exacerbated concerns.'
			[6639] StaticText 'The convoy was traveling toward Mandalay when it was fired upon by soldiers with machine guns, forcing it to turn back, the TNLA said in a Telegram post late on Tuesday.'
			[6641] StaticText 'A junta spokesperson later confirmed that soldiers had shot at the vehicles, saying they had not been notified that the convoy would be passing through and fired warning shots after it failed to stop.'

			[6656] StaticText 'But this is not the first time the junta has attacked aid workers, Mr Quinley said.'
			[6658] StaticText '"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can\'t monitor it and they can\'t use it how they want, they restrict it," he said. "They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers."'
			[6660] StaticText 'The junta, which began fighting a civil war with resistance forces in Myanmar after it seized control of the country in 2021, has a history of weaponising aid and humanitarian assistance: funnelling it towards areas that are under its control and restricting it in areas that are not.'
