			[6617] StaticText '"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in," he added. "Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don\'t believe that\'s totally legitimate."'

			[6658] StaticText '"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can\'t monitor it and they can\'t use it how they want, they restrict it," he said. "They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers."'
