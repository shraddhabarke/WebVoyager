		[3187] StaticText 'The model consists of 28 layers with a model dimension of 4096, and a feedforward dimension of 16384. The model dimension is split into 16 heads, each with a dimension of 256. Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is applied to 64 dimensions of each head. The model is trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of BPEs as GPT-2/GPT-3.'

		[3221] StaticText 'not'
		[3222] StaticText ' intended for deployment without fine-tuning, supervision, and/or moderation. It is not a in itself a product and cannot be used for human-facing interactions. For example, the model may generate harmful or offensive text. Please evaluate the risks associated with your particular use case.'
		[3225] StaticText 'GPT-J-6B was trained on an English-language only dataset, and is thus '
		[3228] StaticText ' suitable for translation or generating text in other languages.'
		[3231] StaticText 'GPT-J-6B has not been fine-tuned for downstream contexts in which language models are commonly deployed, such as writing genre prose, or commercial chatbots. This means GPT-J-6B will '
		[3234] StaticText ' respond to a given prompt the way a product like ChatGPT does. This is because, unlike this model, ChatGPT was fine-tuned using methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to better ‚Äúfollow‚Äù human instructions.'

		[3250] StaticText 'The core functionality of GPT-J is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work. When prompting GPT-J it is important to remember that the statistically most likely next token is often not the token that produces the most "accurate" text. Never depend upon GPT-J to produce factually accurate output.'
