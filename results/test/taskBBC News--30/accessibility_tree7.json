It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\""
