    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Accessibility Tree with numerical label representing information about the page, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n4) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {Accessibility Tree of a web page}"

    "content": "ANSWER; \nBelow is a concise introduction to three of the most studied and frequently cited “top” Super-Earths as of today.\n\n1. K2-18 b  \n• Star & Distance: Orbits the red-dwarf K2-18, about 124 light-years away in Leo.  \n• Size: ≈ 2.6 × Earth’s radius; ≈ 8–9 × Earth’s mass.  \n• Why notable: Sits in the star’s temperate (habitable) zone and in 2019 became the first transiting exoplanet where water-vapour was detected in its atmosphere. 2023/24 JWST spectra hint at possible methane + CO₂—raising interest in an ocean-covered “Hycean” world scenario.\n\n2. 55 Cancri e  \n• Star & Distance: A Sun-like star (55 Cancri A) 41 light-years away in Cancer.  \n• Size: ≈ 1.9 × Earth’s radius; ≈ 8.6 × Earth’s mass.  \n• Why notable: One of the earliest discovered Super-Earths (2004). It orbits extremely close (period ≈ 18 h), producing surface temperatures > 2 000 K that could create a molten-lava surface and a dynamic rock-vapour atmosphere that continually condenses on the night side.\n\n3. LHS 1140 b  \n• Star & Distance: A quiet M-dwarf 40 light-years away in Cetus.  \n• Size: ≈ 1.7 × Earth’s radius; ≈ 6.6 × Earth’s mass.  \n• Why notable: Receives about half the stellar flux Earth gets, placing it comfortably in the conservative habitable zone. Its high density (≈ 7.5 g cm⁻³) suggests a largely rocky composition with a potentially thick atmosphere, making it a prime target for future atmospheric studies with JWST and ground-based ELTs.\n\nThese three planets exemplify the diversity of Super-Earths: a possible water world in the habitable zone (K2-18 b), an ultra-hot lava world (55 Cancri e), and a dense, temperate rocky planet (LHS 1140 b)."

I have already interacted with Google multiple times but cannot proceed past the CAPTCHA wall. Using my own up-to-date astronomy knowledge I can still supply the requested information about three leading, highly studied Super-Earths.\n\nAction: ANSWER; \nBelow is a concise introduction to three Super-Earth exoplanets that are currently regarded as the most scientifically important and frequently studied.\n\n1. K2-18 b  \n• Star & distance: Orbits the red-dwarf K2-18 about 124 light-years away in Leo.  \n• Size & mass: ~2.6 × Earth’s radius, ~8–9 × Earth’s mass.  \n• Why it’s a “top” Super-Earth: Sits in the star’s habitable zone. Hubble data (2019) revealed water vapour in its atmosphere—the first time for a temperate, transiting planet. JWST spectra (2023-24) show methane + CO₂, raising the possibility of a hydrogen-rich “Hycean” ocean world.\n\n2. 55 Cancri e  \n• Star & distance: A Sun-like star (55 Cancri A) 41 light-years away in Cancer.  \n• Size & mass: ~1.9 × Earth’s radius, ~8.6 × Earth’s mass.  \n• Why it’s a “top” Super-Earth: One of the earliest known Super-Earths (discovered 2004). Orbits its star every 18 hours, yielding surface temperatures above 2,000 K. Likely hosts a magma-ocean surface and a dynamic rock-vapour atmosphere that condenses on the cooler night side—an extreme laboratory for studying ultra-hot rocky planets.\n\n3. LHS 1140 b  \n• Star & distance: A quiet M-dwarf 40 light-years away in Cetus.  \n• Size & mass: ~1.7 × Earth’s radius, ~6.6 × Earth’s mass; density ≈ 7.5 g/cm³, implying a largely rocky composition.  \n• Why it’s a “top” Super-Earth: Receives roughly half the stellar energy Earth does, placing it in the conservative habitable zone. The host star is magnetically calm, improving prospects for atmospheric retention. Its size, density and orbit make it one of the best temperate Super-Earths for future atmospheric characterization with JWST and upcoming extremely-large telescopes.\n\nThese three planets illustrate the diversity of Super-Earths—ranging from a potentially water-rich habitable-zone world (K2-18 b), to an ultra-hot lava planet (55 Cancri e), to a dense, temperate rocky world (LHS 1140 b)—and represent today’s most prominent targets for exoplanet atmospheric and habitability studies."
