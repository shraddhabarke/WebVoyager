			[4750] StaticText 'The move, which is part of his strategy to win back customers, comes as other food and drink chains increasingly adopt technology to cut costs.'
			[4752] StaticText 'Also on Tuesday, the firm announced worse-than-expected financial results as its sales continue to fall.'
			[4754] StaticText 'Mr Niccol was brought into Starbucks last year tasked with turning the business around as it struggles with rising prices and consumers cut back spending.'
			[4766] StaticText '"Over the last couple of years, we\'ve actually been removing labour from the stores. I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour," Mr Niccol said during a call with investors.'
			[4768] StaticText '"What we\'re finding is... that wasn\'t an accurate assumption with what played out."'
			[4770] StaticText 'Increasing staff numbers was tested in a handful of stores around the time Mr Niccol joined the firm in September 2024. He has been expanding the approach to include around 3,000 stores this year.'
			[4772] StaticText 'At the same time the firm said it will pull back from deploying its Siren drink-making system.'
			[4774] StaticText 'Named after the iconic Starbucks logo, it is a suite of technology and equipment that was introduced in 2022 to help streamline operations.'
