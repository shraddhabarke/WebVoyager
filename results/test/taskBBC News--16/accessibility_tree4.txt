			[3462] StaticText 'The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to "reset" relations after Brexit.'
			[3464] StaticText 'Labour has previously said it has "no plans" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.'
			[3466] StaticText 'But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a "running commentary" on talks.'
			[3468] StaticText 'It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a "new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30".'
