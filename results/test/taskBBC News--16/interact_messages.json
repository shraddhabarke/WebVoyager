In each iteration, you will receive an Accessibility Tree with numerical label representing information about the page, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer.

After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages.

    "content": "ANSWER; Most recent BBC News update on Brexit negotiations\n\nHeadline: “UK edges towards post‑Brexit youth visa deal with EU”  (published 5 days ago – the newest dated report in the BBC Brexit‑talks news feed)\n\nKey points\n•  UK Labour government has stopped ruling out a reciprocal “youth mobility” visa scheme with the EU.  \n•  The idea is now on the table ahead of a UK‑EU summit in London on 19 May that aims to “reset” relations and agree a wider cooperation package.  \n•  EU negotiators have made the youth‑visa arrangement one of their main demands in the continuing post‑Brexit talks.  \n•  More than 60 Labour MPs have written to ministers urging a bespoke deal allowing under‑30s to work or study in each other’s countries for limited periods.  \n•  After a meeting between PM Sir Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both sides said “good progress” had been made and ordered officials to keep working toward an “ambitious package”.\n\nStated or implied economic impacts on Europe\n•  A youth‑visa pact is framed by EU diplomats as part of a “package approach” in which progress in one field unlocks movement in others, including defence and economic cooperation.  \n•  Closer economic ties would give European (and British) firms better market access; a separate defence‑and‑security accord could open the UK to the EU’s €150 billion loan facility and allow European suppliers a larger share of funded projects.  \n•  German ambassador Miguel Berger said easing mobility barriers would create “new cultural, educational and economic opportunities”, signalling that European labour markets and universities could benefit from UK talent and spending."
