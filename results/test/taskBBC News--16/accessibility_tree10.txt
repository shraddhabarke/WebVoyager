			[4634] StaticText 'The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to "reset" relations after Brexit.'

			[4640] StaticText 'It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a "new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30".'
