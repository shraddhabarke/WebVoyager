    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Accessibility Tree with numerical label representing information about the page, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n4) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {Accessibility Tree of a web page}"

    "content": "ANSWER;  \nTake a regular pentagram whose outer vertices lie on the unit circle, i.e.  \n\n Vₖ = (cos 72° k , sin 72° k), k = 0,…,4.  \n\nEach side of the inner pentagon is a diagonal (Vₖ , Vₖ₊₂).  \nWriting φ = (1+√5)/2 and a = φ−1 = (√5−1)/2, the five diagonals have the linear equations  \n\n ℓₖ(x,y) := sin 36° ( cos 72° k − x ) − cos 36° ( sin 72° k − y ) = 0, k=0,…,4  \n\nwhich can be rearranged to the compact form  \n\n cos 72° k · y − sin 72° k · x + a = 0.  \n\nThe inner region (the small convex pentagon) is the intersection of the corresponding half-planes that contain the centre (0,0); therefore its defining constraint is the set of five simultaneous inequalities  \n\n cos 72° k · y − sin 72° k · x + a ≥ 0,  k = 0,1,2,3,4,  with a = (√5−1)/2.  \n\nEquivalently, in explicit numerical form:  \n\n 0.3090 y − 0.9511 x + 0.6180 ≥ 0  \n 0.8090 y − 0.5878 x + 0.6180 ≥ 0  \n 1.0000 y             + 0.6180 ≥ 0  \n 0.8090 y + 0.5878 x + 0.6180 ≥ 0  \n 0.3090 y + 0.9511 x + 0.6180 ≥ 0.  \n\nThe set of points (x,y) satisfying all five of these linear inequalities is exactly the inner pentagon of the regular pentagram."
