    "content": "Imagine you are a robot browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an Accessibility Tree with numerical label representing information about the page, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a Web Element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. \n3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.\n4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.\n5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n6. Google, directly jump to the Google search page. When you can't find information in some websites, try starting over with Google.\n7. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:\n- Click [Numerical_Label]\n- Type [Numerical_Label]; [Content]\n- Scroll [Numerical_Label or WINDOW]; [up or down]\n- Wait\n- GoBack\n- Google\n- ANSWER; [content]\n\nKey Guidelines You MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n1) To input text, NO need to click textbox first, directly type content. After typing, the system automatically hits `ENTER` key. Sometimes you should click the search button to apply search filters. Try to use simple language when searching.  \n2) You must Distinguish between textbox and search button, don't type content into the button! If no textbox is found, you may need to click the search button first before the textbox is displayed. \n3) Execute only one action per iteration. \n4) STRICTLY Avoid repeating the same action if the webpage remains unchanged. You may have selected the wrong web element or numerical label. Continuous use of the Wait is also NOT allowed.\n5) When a complex Task involves multiple questions or steps, select \"ANSWER\" only at the very end, after addressing all of these questions (steps). Flexibly combine your own abilities with the information in the web page. Double check the formatting requirements in the task when ANSWER. \n* Web Browsing Guidelines *\n1) Don't interact with useless web elements like Login, Sign-in, donation that appear in Webpages. Pay attention to Key Web Elements like search textbox and menu.\n2) Vsit video websites like YouTube is allowed BUT you can't play videos. Clicking to download PDF is allowed and will be analyzed by the Assistant API.\n3) Focus on the date in task, you must look for results that match the date. It may be necessary to find the correct year, month and day at calendar.\n4) Pay attention to the filter and sort functions on the page, which, combined with scroll, can help you solve conditions like 'highest', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'earliest', etc. Try your best to find the answer that best fits the task.\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: {Your brief thoughts (briefly summarize the info that will help ANSWER)}\nAction: {One Action format you choose}\n\nThen the User will provide:\nObservation: {Accessibility Tree of a web page}"

    "content": "ANSWER; \nCambridge Dictionary – Summary of the main rules for forming and using comparative and superlative adjectives (with examples taken from the Grammar page “Comparison: adjectives – bigger, biggest, more interesting”):\n\n1. One–syllable adjectives  \n   • Add –er for the comparative and –est for the superlative.  \n     tall → taller → (the) tallest  \n     cheap → cheaper → (the) cheapest  \n   • If the adjective ends in a single vowel + single consonant, double the final consonant before adding –er/–est.  \n     big → bigger → biggest  \n     thin → thinner → thinnest  \n\n2. Adjectives ending in –e  \n   • Just add –r / –st.  \n     late → later → latest  \n\n3. Two‑syllable adjectives ending in –y  \n   • Change –y to –i and add –er / –est.  \n     happy → happier → happiest  \n     busy → busier → busiest  \n   Example: “Are you happier now that you’ve changed your job?”\n\n4. Some other two‑syllable adjectives (often ending in an unstressed vowel sound) can also take –er / –est:  \n   clever → cleverer → cleverest; quiet → quieter → quietest; narrow → narrower → narrowest; simple → simpler → simplest  \n   Example: “The guest bedroom is the quietest room in the house.”\n\n5. Two‑syllable adjectives ending in –ful and most adjectives of three or more syllables  \n   • Form the comparative with more/less and the superlative with most/least.  \n     useful → more useful → (the) most useful  \n     careful → more careful → (the) most careful  \n     interesting → more interesting → (the) most interesting  \n   Example: “This dictionary is more useful than the one we had before.”  \n   Example: “London is the most popular tourist destination in England.”\n\n6. Irregular forms  \n   good → better → best  \n   bad → worse → worst  \n   far → farther/further → farthest/furthest  \n   Example: “Pluto is the furthest planet from the sun in our solar system.”\n\n7. Never use more/most together with an –er/–est form:  \n   ✗ “a more better life”  → ✓ “a better life”  \n   ✗ “the most biggest beach” → ✓ “the biggest beach”\n\n8. Intensifying or softening comparatives  \n   • Strengthen with much, a lot, far, even, rather, etc.:  \n     “This food is much better than the food we had yesterday.”  \n   • Soften with a little / a bit (less formal):  \n     “She feels a little more confident now.”\n\n9. Using than with comparatives  \n   • The word than usually follows comparative adjectives to introduce the second element of comparison:  \n     “We were busier last week than this week.”  \n\n10. Using the definite article with superlatives  \n    • Superlatives normally take the before them:  \n      “That was the easiest exam I’ve ever taken.”  \n    • To express membership of a group, use one of the + superlative + plural noun:  \n      “Marmaris beach is one of the biggest in Turkey.”\n\n11. less / least comparatives and superlatives  \n    • less + adjective for a weaker comparison; least + adjective for the superlative of small degree:  \n      “That way is less complicated.”  \n      “This is the least harmful chemical.”\n\nThese points cover the principal Cambridge Grammar rules for forming and using comparative and superlative adjectives, together with authentic example sentences supplied by the dictionary."
