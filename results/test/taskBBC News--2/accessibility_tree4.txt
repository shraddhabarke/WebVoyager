			[5009] StaticText 'A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém.'
			[5011] StaticText 'It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.'
			[5013] StaticText 'The state government touts the highway\'s "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.'
			[5015] StaticText 'The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.'
			[5027] StaticText 'Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém.'
