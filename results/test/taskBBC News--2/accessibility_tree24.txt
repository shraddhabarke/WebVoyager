It has a black cone-like base, an orange l-shaped top that has the look of foil, with the antenna attached and furled. To the left of the satellite sit two shells which will hold the satellite, they are white elongated cones with "ESA" written on them, and held in blue scaffolding trolleys.

			[14299] StaticText 'The world\'s rainforests are often referred to as the "lungs of the earth".'
			[14301] StaticText 'They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.'
			[14303] StaticText 'But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.'
			[14305] StaticText 'On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.'
			[14307] StaticText 'It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.'

			[14340] StaticText 'The satellite on board has been affectionately named "space brolly" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.'
			[14342] StaticText '"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside," Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.'
			[14344] StaticText 'He said that it would be a major achievement "to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia".'
			[14346] StaticText 'The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.'
