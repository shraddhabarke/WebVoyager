			[7995] StaticText 'A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém.'
			[7997] StaticText 'It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.'
			[7999] StaticText 'The state government touts the highway\'s "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.'
			[8001] StaticText 'The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.'
