The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.'
